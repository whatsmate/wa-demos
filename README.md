# How to run the sample code

First, follow the instructions to register your phone (or your recipient's phone) with the WhatsApp Gateway:

* http://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway-api.html

Then, explore the scripts in this repo and run them. The name of the directories indicates the programming language they contain.

Just change to the corresponding directory and run the scripts there. Of course, you want to read the scripts and understand them before running them. Each script is independent and self-contained.

For example,

```
cd python
[EDIT THE FILE enterprise-demo-app.py]
python enterprise-demo-app.py
```
